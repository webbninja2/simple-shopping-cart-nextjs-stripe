# Simple Admin Panel in React

## Overview
This project is a simple admin panel built using React.js, leveraging Material-UI (MUI) for the design components. It features a dummy login system, a dashboard page with dynamic navigation, and a basic user CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality implemented with Redux Toolkit. Note that this project does not include API integrations; all data management is handled locally.

## Features

- **Login System**: Utilizes a dummy object for user authentication. Upon successful login, users are redirected to the dashboard page.
- **Dashboard**: Once logged in, users are taken to a dashboard with a dynamic navigation drawer.
- **Dynamic Navigation**: The navigation drawer in the dashboard is built using MUI's Drawer component and supports dynamic menu items.
- **User CRUD Operations**: Simple user management system allowing the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of users, implemented using Redux Toolkit for state management.
  
## Technologies Used
